      <description>The security oriented podcasts I listen to regularly are:
 SANS StormCasts - the quick no-nonsense daily fix.
 Smashing Security - the familiar weekly chat about cybercrime, hacking, and online privacy. Malicious Life - Listen to tales from the annals of cybersecurity and cyberwar from time to time.  Also worth mentioning (but not yet regular on my list):

      <description>Hi there My name is Kresten Jacobsen and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this site. I setup this site to help me understand things as I learn and to remember them later.
I have had an interest in cybersecurity ever since I studied computer science, but only recently converted to full time IT security specialist. I have a lot to learn, so forgive me for saying some complete bull**** from time to time.</description>

      <description> &amp;ldquo;Hello, friend?&amp;rdquo; That&amp;rsquo;s lame. Maybe I should give you a name&amp;hellip;
But that&amp;rsquo;s a slippery slope.
You&amp;rsquo;re only in my head.
We have to remember that&amp;hellip;
Shit.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually happened.
I&amp;rsquo;m talking to an imaginary person.
